Using JQVMap with DiscoJuice
============================

You can add a map to your DiscoJuice standalone page. 

The map uses the jquery plugin JQVMap https://github.com/manifestinteractive/jqvmap.
Countries with available providers are highlighted for a visual overview and 
act as a filter for the providers when they are clicked.

The map is by default hidden.
To activate it, you must set the map property of the djc object to  true 
as shown:

`djc.map = true`

To make the plugin work properly, you need to include the JQVMap JavaScript and 
CSS files to your html page.

The prequisite files are:

* jquery.vmap.js
* jquery.world_en.js ( or other if you plan on using other area. For more info on 
	available regions check  [JQvmap maps](https://github.com/manifestinteractive/jqvmap/tree/stable/jqvmap/maps) )
* vmap.css

and can be found inside the jqvmap/ folder of DiscoJuice or  downloaded from 
[JQvmap] (https://github.com/manifestinteractive/jqvmap) 

Note: The jquery.vmap.js used in DiscoJuice is the stable 1.0 version.

User interface customization
----------------------------

After you have activated the map, you can choose to use the following settings 
to configure the map and its area.

These settings are available:

mapTitle
: String. Default : `Select your country`

mapSubtitle
: String. Default : `to filter available providers`

	These two settings form the section that appears above the map.

mapValidColor
: Sting. Default : `#3582AC`

	Color fot the countries that feature available providers(s).

mapHeight
: String. Default: null

	Map div height. If null, map is automatically adjusted.
    

All these settings can be initialised as in the following example:

`djc.mapHeight = "200px";`


Once you have your map up and running you can further customize the looks of
your map.

You can check the JQVMap documentation section for available options.
Bellow is an example of how you can use these options to style your map:

`djc.mapOptions = {
	'color': 'blue',
	'backgroundColor': '#f00',
}`
